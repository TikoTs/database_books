This is what the project does:
  Database Creation: Automatically creates a SQLite database called 'books.sqlite' if it does not exist;
  Data Insertion: Inserts sample book data into the database;
  Update Pages: Allows users to update the number of pages for a specific book by entering the book's ID;
  Statistics: Calculates and displays the average number of pages and the title of the longest book in the database;
  Data Visualization: Generates a horizontal bar chart(using matplotlib) showing the number of pages for each book, sorted by the number of pages.
